# Creating LORA

In this article, I will guide you on how to create your own LORA. Since my computer is not very powerful, I will be using the Seaart.ai website.

## Getting Started

Firstly, we need to determine what we want to train LORA on. You can train it on a specific character or a particular artistic style. In my case, I will be training LORA on my own art pieces to later generate them as references. After all, it's not theft if you steal from yourself :-)

For example, here's one of my works:

# Selecting and Refining Artworks

For this step, follow these instructions:

1. Choose up to 100 drawings.
2. Download all the drawings into a single folder on your computer.
3. Adjust their resolution to a square format compatible with the neural network, such as 512 x 512, 780 x 780, or 1024 x 1024.
   
You can quickly accomplish this using the following website: [BIRME](https://www.birme.net/).
